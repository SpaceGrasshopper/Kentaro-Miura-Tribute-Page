            <h3>The path that Miura walked</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Godfather of manga Kentaro Miura (三浦 建太郎), best known for the acclaimed dark fantasy series
                    Berserk was born on July 11 1966 in Chiba prefectue of Japan</li>
                <li>He created his very first manga for his classmates when he was just 10 years old and won the 34th
                    newcomer manga artist award from the Weekly Shonen Magazine when he was a teenager</li>
                <li>Miura was known as a fastidious draftsman and meticulous storyteller, taking months if not whole
                    years off from the monthly publication schedule of Berserk in order to dedicate more time to the
                    realization of a single panel spread.</li>
                <li>For more than 3 decades, he reached tens of millions of manga and anime fans worldwide with a
                    fantastical tale of vulnerable characters in an apocalyptic world.</li>
                <li>The story of Berserk follows Guts, a fearsome swordsman and mercenary struggling to stay alive in a
                    ruthless medieval world, ravaged by war and even monsters from another dimension. Initially a
                    story of revenge, Berserk explores Guts constant inner conflict between his need to destroy his
                    enemies and his urge to protect those dear to him. In its setting, loosely inspired by medieval
                    Europe, Berserk has introduced themes of redemption, stoicism, and most of all, of humanity, all
                    backed by a staggeringly-detailed level of artwork.</li>
                <li>The influence of “Berserk” can even be seen in popular video games like Dark Souls and on hit TV
                    shows such as “Castlevania” on Netflix.</li>
                <li>Kentaro Miura died on May 6 at 2:48 p.m. due to acute aortic dissection. </li>
            </ul>
